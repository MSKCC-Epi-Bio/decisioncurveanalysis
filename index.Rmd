# Introduction

Diagnostic and prognostic models are typically evaluated with measures of accuracy, such as the area-under-the-curve (AUC) or the Brier score, that do not address clinical consequences. Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but generally require collection of extensive additional information and are cumbersome to apply to models that yield a risk estimate on a continuous scale from 0 to 1. Decision curve analysis allows incorporation of clinical consequences, thus addressing the question of whether a model would do more good than harm, but is able to do so without excessive extraneous data.
