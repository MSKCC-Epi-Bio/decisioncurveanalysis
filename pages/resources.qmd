## Example Datasets

Several datasets commonly used in DCA tutorials and examples:

- **Prostate Cancer Dataset**: Available in the `dcurves` R package
- **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**: Available through UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Melanoma Dataset**: Available in the `rms` R package

## Common Applications of DCA

DCA has been applied in various clinical fields:

- **Oncology**: Predicting cancer recurrence, treatment response
- **Cardiology**: Predicting cardiac events, need for intervention
- **Emergency Medicine**: Triage decisions, hospital admission
- **Surgery**: Predicting post-operative complications

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When should I use DCA instead of traditional metrics?
DCA is particularly useful when clinical decisions are directly informed by model predictions. Unlike ROC curves or calibration plots, DCA directly addresses the question of clinical utility.

### How do I choose appropriate threshold probabilities?
Threshold probabilities should reflect the point at which a clinician or patient would opt for intervention. This depends on weighing the relative harms of false positives against the benefits of true positives.

### Can DCA be applied to time-to-event outcomes?
Yes, DCA has been extended to survival data. The `dcurves` package includes functionality for time-to-event outcomes.

### How does DCA handle missing data?
DCA itself doesn't address missing data. Models should be developed with appropriate methods for handling missing data before applying DCA.
